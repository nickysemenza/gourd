40.5 g AP flour
40.5 g water
.6 g instant yeast
;In a small clean bowl - using a small spatula or your hand, mix together the flour, warm water (80F), and yeast. Stir until homogenous and combined.
;Cover with a lid or wrap, and leave on the counter for 12-18 hours. I prefer to leave it in my oven (off), because my kitchen gets cold at night.

43.2 g milk
140.4 g water
194.4g bread flour
21.6g whole wheat flour
;Start the autolyse by combining the milk and water, bringing the temperature of the liquids to (80F). Add almost all of the milk and water mixture, to the blend of flours - reserving approximately 60g.
;Mix together the flour and liquids by hand until homogenous and no shaggy bits remain. Cover and set aside for 45 minutes.

3.24g instant yeast
4.32g honey
;Add the yeast, honey, and 30g of the reserved liquid to the bowl of preferment. Mix to combine.
;Using the “Rubaud” mixing method, incorporate the preferment into the dough by hand.
;After thoroughly combined, cover and place somewhere warm to rest for 25 minutes. Take note of the time, or start a timer, this marks the start of the bulk proof.

4.83g salt
32.4 g evoo
;Add the salt, remaining water/milk, and olive oil to the dough. Using the “rubaud” method, mix the dough together until homogenous, soft and supple. This mixing should take around 5 minutes by hand.
;Cover the bowl and place somewhere warm for 30 minutes. An ideal dough temperature throughout the proof is 78º-80ºF.
;After the rest, begin a series of stretch and folds. With slightly wet and warm hands - grab a piece of dough from the edge of the bowl and pull upwards, stretching the dough and pull towards the center of the mass. Turn the bowl a 1/6th of the way around, grab an adjacent piece of dough, and pull upwards stretching and folding the dough over itself, bunching the dough in the center onto itself. Repeat this process, rounding the dough for 4-8 stretch and folds. As best you can, gently flip the dough over itself, placing all the folded seams down on the base of the bowl. Cover and let rest 30 minutes.
;After the dough has rested, repeat the same stretch and fold technique once more. Stretching and folding dough up and around itself 6-8 times, but instead of flipping the dough over into the same bowl - transfer to a clean, dry, container with a lid for proofing. Place somewhere warm, and rest for 30 minutes.
;After the dough has rested, you’ll begin a series of coil folds, every 30 minutes, for remaining bulk proofing time. With wet hands, grab the dough from the center and pull upwards stretching the two ends of the dough long. Allow the end furthest away from you tuck underneath and the dough mass and then gently place the dough down on top of the fold. Rotate the pan 180º, and grabbing the whole mass of dough stretch upwards, allowing the now far end to tuck underneath. Rotate the pan 90º and repeat this process in the other direction. Rotate the pan another 90º and complete the 4 sides fold on the last side of the coil. Cover and let rest 30 minutes.
;Continue the same process of coil folds every 30 minutes over the next 4 hours. Monitor the temperature of your dough, its growth, and its strength building with each series of folds - taking care not to deflate the dough when handling.
;When the dough has doubled in size and does not spread to the edges of the pan after its folds and 30 minutes rest the bulk proof is complete. This usually takes 4-6 hours.
;Place the dough covered in cold (37ºF) storage for 14-18 hours.
;Remove the dough from cold storage and using a dough knife portion and weigh the dough on a clean work surface.
;Once portioned, carefully fold the dough into rounds preshaping. Allow to rest uncovered for 25 minutes.
;Using a dough knife, give the dough a final shape, tightening the surface and rolling the balls into rounds. Rest uncovered for 25 minutes.
;Transfer the dough to liberally sprayed and oiled baking pans. Allow to rest, covered, for 2-4 hours at 78F-80ºF until relaxed and doubled in size.
;Preheat your oven to 500ºF at least, one hour prior to baking.
;Once dough has proofed, drizzle with olive oil, and with oiled hands, aggressively dimple the dough. Place on the toppings and bake.
;Immediately lower the oven to 425ºF and bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown and bubbling.
;Once baked, quickly remove the pizza from the pans and place on a wire rack to cool and preserve the crispy crust.
